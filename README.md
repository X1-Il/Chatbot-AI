# Chatbot-AI
A chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.
Make sure you have the OpenAI Python library (openai) installed. You'll also need to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key.

Once you have everything set up, simply run the script. The chatbot will prompt you to enter your input as a user, and it will generate a response based on the input using the GPT-3.5 language model. To stop the chatbot, enter "quit" as the user input.
